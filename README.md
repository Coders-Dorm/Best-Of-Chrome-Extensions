# How to use these extensionsüß© ?
If you'd like to use these extensions for yourself, or perhaps use parts of it and modify the rest, here's how you will need to set it up:

- Clone this repository.
- Find out the extension that excites you.
- If you'd like to further customize it or make any other edits to the page, you will likely want to do that in either the `popup.html` file or the `script.js` file.
- Once you've made your desired changes (if any), open Chrome and navigate to `chrome://extensions/`.
- Click the toggle in the upper-right corner marker "Developer Mode".
- You should then see three new buttons towards the top of your screen.
- Click "Load Unpacked", and then select the folder containing this repository.
- You can then turn off Developer Mode.
- Now, when you open up a new tab, you should see the customized page!
